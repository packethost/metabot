### How to Submit Change Requests
Please submit change requests and / or features via [Issues](https://github.com/packethost/metabot/issues). There's no guarantee it'll be changed, but you never know until you try. I'll try to add comments as soon as possible, though.

### How to Report a Bug
Bugs are problems in code, in the functionality of an application or in its UI design; you can submit them through [Issues](https://github.com/packethost/metabot/issues) as well.

### Templates
There are three templates available in the Issues section - which is why we ask for both change requests and bugs be filed via [Issues](https://github.com/packethost/metabot/issues). The three templates are:
  - Bug report: Create a report to help us improve
  - Feature request: Suggest an idea for this project
  - Not a Bug Not a Feature: File an issue that's not a bug nor a feature; cause you're discerning
